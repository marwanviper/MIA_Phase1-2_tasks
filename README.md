# Neural Network for MNIST Classification

## Introduction

Neural Networks are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the way the human brain works, capable of processing complex data and learning from experience. They are particularly effective in fields like image recognition, speech processing, and even autonomous systems. In this project, we explore the basics of neural networks by building one from scratch, understanding key concepts, and applying the model to a real-world problem: classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements

### 1. Neural Network from Scratch:
- **Objective**: Build a Neural Network from scratch based on the concepts in Michael Nielsen’s *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* (Chapter 1).
- **Implementation**: Without using any deep learning libraries, implement forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent for training the network.
- **Learnings**: As you work through the chapter, summarize the key concepts and challenges encountered.

### 2. MNIST Classification:
- **Objective**: Use the neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Task**: Ensure that the model can accurately recognize and predict digit labels (0-9) by training on the MNIST dataset.

### 3. Build with PyTorch or TensorFlow:
- **Objective**: After implementing the network from scratch, create an equivalent model using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- **Task**: Compare the two implementations in terms of ease of use, performance, and flexibility, and document the comparison.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Building the Neural Network from Scratch
- **Architecture**: The network consists of an input layer (784 nodes), a hidden layer, and an output layer (10 nodes for each digit).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Forward Propagation**: Calculate the output of the network for each input by passing data through the hidden layers.
  - **Backpropagation**: Compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases to minimize the error.
  - **Gradient Descent**: Update the weights and biases using the computed gradients to reduce the loss over time.

### Step 2: Training and Testing on the MNIST Dataset
- The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing handwritten digits.
- The neural network was trained on this dataset, achieving satisfactory accuracy for digit classification.

### Step 3: Implementing the Model with PyTorch
- After building the neural network from scratch, we implemented the same architecture using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The implementation in PyTorch simplifies several tasks such as automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.

## Comparison of Neural Network Implementations


## 1. Ease of Use

- **From Scratch**:  
  Building a neural network from scratch required manually implementing forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient calculations, and weight updates. While this gave a deep understanding of how neural networks work, it was labor-intensive.

- **PyTorch**:  
  PyTorch provides a high-level API that abstracts away much of the complexity involved in neural network training. The framework automates the computation of gradients, optimizes weight updates, and provides utilities for dataset loading and transformation.

## 2. Performance

- **From Scratch**:  
  Since all operations were implemented using basic matrix manipulations (with NumPy), the performance could be slower, especially for larger datasets or more complex networks.

- **PyTorch**:  
  PyTorch is optimized for performance and can leverage hardware acceleration (like GPUs) to speed up training. Additionally, it offers pre-implemented layers, loss functions, and optimization techniques, making it faster to train models.

## 3. Flexibility

- **From Scratch**:  
  Writing everything from scratch allows complete control over the network’s internals. It’s highly flexible but more error-prone and time-consuming.

- **PyTorch**:  
  PyTorch is flexible in the sense that it allows dynamic computation graphs (eager execution), which means you can modify the network on the fly. While the underlying operations are abstracted, you still retain significant control over the network architecture and behavior.

## Conclusion

- **From Scratch**:  
  Building a neural network from scratch is a valuable learning exercise for understanding the inner workings of neural networks.

- **PyTorch**:  
  Using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow significantly simplifies the process and is more practical for real-world applications due to better performance, ease of use, and flexibility.
